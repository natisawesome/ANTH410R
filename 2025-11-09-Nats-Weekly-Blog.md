# Week 12

This week we are focusing on Photography. I was actually in San Diego for a conference this week. I had a lot of roles and responsibilies that kept me busy from about 6:00AM to 9:00PM everynight because of the sessions, panels, events, and buisness meetings I was involved with as an individual on the board of directors. That did not leave much time for this weeks assignments. However, I was able to fit in an interview with one of my good friend and fellow board member, Kat whom has given me permission to identify her, use her image, and use her quotes. 

Just to give some brief context Kat has been a student board member for 2 years and serves as a mentor for the new student board members myself included. She is an amazing role model and very open with her struggles in her role and in her life. Hearing Kat speak about common issues is such an inspiring thing to be part of I could not have wished for a better mentor on the board. Kat and I talk a lot about the welfair of students and how universitys can engage better with them to create positive environments. This time it lead to us discussing how we can open up more discourse surrounding student burn out and lack of motivation. Kat used the analogy of coffee to discuss this:
SHort Portion of Interview with Kat:

K: "Coffee is not just a drink it is a way of life."

N: What makes you say that?

K: "Sometimes when I do not feel like getting up in the morning or taking on responsibilities a moment of peace, quiet, and coffee give me the energy to take on the day. Coffee may not be the same for everyone find something that means coffee to you."



I really like this analogy because she is spot on. The things that recharge you and give you motivation for life are different for everyone. It is identifying those things that is most important. This lead to Kat and I discussing what were ways we could help students identify their motivation and what recharges them. We came up with a couple ideas such as creating a space at the next conference where students can make collages of things that motivate them, or share things that recharge them. Creating a panel or roundtable to discuss this and coming up with proactive ways to generate and foster student understanding is vital to student mental health. 

Anyway basically I had a great time this week and although this blog did not reflect my photgraphy skills which are subpar, I truly did enjoy the interview I had with my friend.
