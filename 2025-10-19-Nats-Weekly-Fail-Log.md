# Week 10 fail log
## Summary of my Experience
Social Media Outreach 

### Social Media  
I really like this week's social media focus. I follow a lot of anthropologists and archaeologists on my social media, so it was easy to find something that interested me. I absolutely love watching content from Steph the Archaeologist, so I had to give her a shoutout. I also enjoyed making the meme this week; it was an awesome exercise

## What to Work on for Next Week
- Continue final project

# Readings

## Bioarchaeology and the Media:Anthropology Scicomm in a Post-TruthLandscape
### comments
- I feel like in anthropology this would be difficult to achieve. Defining your audience would be especially difficult. The way that articles are written is not necessarily accessible to the general public so you would first have to reassess how the information is getting to the public and then define your audience. However, like we have all seen with the social media there are a lot of anthropologists who spread information about what they are doing. I think this is a really good way to reach people
- Exactly!! If an anthropologist wanted to focus on writing which the general public could understand it would not be accepted as academic. This "publish-or-perish mentality" makes it extremely difficult for anthropology to branch out and become more prevalent to the public. Those who would be best to teach the public about anthropology and the importance of what is studied in the field are trapped in the academic red tape
- I agree with you. I do not think this would be trivial. Especially if a larger organization started one.

## Anthropology, Empathy,and the Need for SocialScience Communication
### comments
- I have had multiple people ask me if anthropology is the study of ants. I agree that this field needs more exposure and representation to our society
- I had never heard about a science communication teaching and research programs before. I would be interested to see what could happen if social sciences were included in that. I believe it would probably fix our lack of exposure, allowing for more discourse about what anthropologists can bring understanding to.

# Discussion Post

## Social Media:

I follow Steph the Archaeologists on Facebook who makes short content form posts about what she is doing. This week she is in Istanbul. I really enjoyed learning about Byzantine history in Istanbul. Steph showed the ancient city of Constantinople and taught her followers about the aqueduct of Valens. She also taught us about the church of Saint Polyeuctus and the Theodoseus forum. The church of Saint Polyeuctus was the largest church in Constantinople before Hagia Sophia was built. I really enjoy Stephs content because it teaches a lot about history and blends in archaeology. 

## Meme:

My meme is from Lord of the Rings. I chose this because I am a big fan of Lord of the Rings. The caption reads, "One does not simply do anthropological research without a data management plan." This is because I feel like I learned a lot from the data management plan unit on the importance of having data management plans. Therefore, I thought it was fitting to use one of my favorite book and movie series to say something about the need for a data management plan in anthropological research.
