## Summary of my experience
## Struggles and Successes
### Onenote
I currently use OneNote and link it to Word documents as needed, but it's not my absolute favorite way to take notes. I prefer handwriting my notes because I learn better that way. However, OneNote is certainly useful. It allows you to link notebooks to Word documents, and I appreciate that it lets you create a notebook with multiple pages. I like to dedicate one page a week per class for my notes. 

OneNote has many features and provides a lot of space on each page, so you can write as much as you need without any issues. I'm also partial to OneNote because if you use the Control + F function in a notebook, it will search through all the pages, making it easier to find something specific without having to sift through each page manually.

Overall, I really like OneNote. The only negative aspect I would mention is the image formatting. I often struggle with inserting images, as it sometimes creates an extra box or fails to create one when needed, which can make things messy. However, this may be more about my own lack of technological know how, rather than OneNote itself.
### Joplin
I wanted to try out a new type of note-taking that is more accessible and translatable to GitHub, so I looked into note-taking apps that work with markdowns. I discovered an app called Joplin.

I actually really like Joplin because it offers a user-friendly way to format your notes without needing to memorize markdown characters for specific tasks. It has buttons for bold, italics, and other formatting options, making it simple to use. Additionally, Joplin provides a comprehensive explanation of markdown and includes a welcome guide that walks you through it step by step. 

One of my favorite features is the side-by-side view of your markdown and regular notes. This way, I can see what my notes will look like as I type, rather than committing changes and discovering later that I've made formatting mistakes. Once I'm done typing, there's an option in the upper right corner to view just the notes, which is fantastic. 

Overall, I really like this interface and how it works. It's similar to OneNote or Word documents, which I typically use for most of my classes. I like the idea of notebooks and pages, but Joplin offers the same concept with markdown support.

Also, I was struggling to get my GitHub to format seperate paragraphs or sentences properly without use of a bullet point, if I copy paste from Joplin it formats exactly the same as on Joplin. From now on that is how I will be doing my notes.

Sidenote: In the welcome guide Joplin provides they shout out GitHub.

### Paper 
 want to give a shout-out to this style of note-taking that I really love. However, there are a few downsides. Unfortunately, when a professor is going quickly, it’s much easier for me to type than to write, so I can keep up. As I mentioned in my discussion post for this week, I’m left-handed, so my notes tend to smudge A LOT. This is often challenging to address; sometimes I find pens that work for a while, but later they won't (if I order new ones or replace the ink). I’ve also realized that when I use pencils, the words can smudge so badly that I can't read them.

Although I prefer writing notes because I learn better that way, I often resort to digital platforms for note-taking. I only write on paper when I need to remember something specific or need to resolve a tab issue on my computer. I don’t really like to split-screen, so if I have to switch back and forth between readings and assignments to find quotes (since many of my other classes just scan in pages and we can’t copy and paste), I either write down the quotes or take a picture on my phone and then retype them.

I think that conversation could lead to a different discussion about open access and accessibility. It often feels like it just creates busywork for students. Anyway, I love taking notes on paper, but in this digital age, it’s just not practical to rely on that alone.
### Readings and Discussion
## Progress on my Struggles from Last Week
### What to Work on 
## Readings for the Week
- The "Proto-Language" of Anthropological Practice
- ethnoGRAPHIC fieldnotes
### Annotations of The "Proto-Language" of Anthropological Practice
- "I took an independent study where I did an ethnography over a summer. One book I found very helpful was Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes by Robert Emerson. I highly recommended, it taught me a lot."
- "I really love the visual this gives us. Reading your own writing allows you to reflect and learn from your previous work. I have definitely done this, and it is an essential part of learning how to write fieldnotes or ethnographies. Self-reflection of our own work while considering how we can improve is a key aspect of growing and learning."
- "Yes!! When I was working on my ethnography and went back to summarize and write it up, I realized I had experienced this exact moment. It's a common part of learning how to write ethnographies and field notes. You often come to the realization that you missed certain details and may not have taken good enough notes to achieve your goals. However, the next time you work on a similar project, you'll know how to improve, and it will be much better because you’ve learned from the experience."
- "Would this performativity affect the results of fieldnotes? Maybe excluding or including things just so one is perceived as more anthropological?"
- "Please correct me if I am wrong but when research involves participant observation, it's important to acknowledge that you may form attachments and develop feelings about certain aspects of the experience. I believe that instead of ignoring these emotions or pretending they don't exist, it may be important to document them in your field notes to avoid bias"
- I love this idea that fieldnotes are the process of becoming."
### Annotations of ethnoGRAPHIC Fieldnotes
- In reply to this quote " Not just for their own sake,but also because of the ideal that anthropologists should be reflective andopen about their role and positioning in relation to the knowledge they gain" I said "Exactly!"
- "While I was writing my ethnography, I did quite a bit of drawing, but I never considered using it to capture small, intimate moments. I usually focused on broader scenes to show the atmosphere or feeling of a place. However, I totally agree with the author’s point, they are spot on, that drawings can effectively emphasize these small, intimate moments. This approach could show the context of a situation much better than words alone, especially for details that might otherwise be overlooked."
- "When I was doing my ethnography I found that taking photos was a really helpful tool. Being able to look back at the photos and put them into words or drawings gave my writing a much more in-depth feeling to it."
- In reply to this quote, "Sometimes I used photographs or just my memory" I said "Yes!!!"
# Week 3 fail log
## Summary of my experience
This week we are focusing on citation management software
- Zotero
## Struggles and Successes
### Zotero
- This week I really struggled with Zotero. I had already had an account and used it for other things but it did not seem to be linked to any of my emails and I could not regain access to it. I had to log out of that account and all of my citations are gone. I created a new account and that was not working for a while it took half an hour to get the account verification email. After that I tried to join the group through the link and that did not work. I checked the discussion board and luckily my professor had a work around where we had to search the group. I searched the group and still got the error message. I had to reset and redownload zotero. Safe to say I have really struggled this week. I was able to overcome everything that I was struggling with but it was very frustrating.
- Using Zotero was super easy as I have already had experience using it for other things. I think I was just having a bad technology week.

### Readings and Discussion (Perusall)
I felt like the readings and video were a lot. The first reading "The medium is the message" was a lot. I struggled throughout the week to read it taking notes as I went through it. I ended up trying to watch the video from Standford to understand some of the topics and then I couldn't access the video until this weekend (I checked the links again and it worked). With the context of the video the first reading was easier to digest. I just felt really overwhelmed this week and I ended up starting a google doc for my notes going back and forth between my tabs was really throwing me and I was just frustrated. Perusall was glitching for me as well a couple times I had written something and it would just submit the first line that I wrote so I ended up writing everything in a google doc and copy pasting. It was not my week for technology and I have come out of this week very frustrated and overwhelmed. 

## Progress on my Struggles from Last Week
- I feel pretty confident in my use of Research Rabbit, Google Scholar, and the Library Website. I am really comfortable using those things.
### What to Work on
The most important things I want to work on are figure out how to use the footnote concept on GitHub to create a table of contents. I feel it in my soul that it is possible to create table on contents with that. The other most important thing I want to work on is to figure out how to find my comments specifically on Persuall (I think I just need to star my comments so I can find all of them fast. Oh also one last thing, I really want to figure out how to seperate my paragraphs on GitHub without using hashtags or bullet points.
- Hopefully my technology decides to work next week
- Use Zotero more often
- Continue becoming more literate using these tools
- Continue to brainstorm ways to incorporate these tools into research.
## Reading for the Week
- The Medium is the Message
- Technology and History: "kranzberg's Laws"
### Annotations "The Medium is the Message"
- "I really liked this example of an abstract painting as it truly shows how we can go from imagination to creation. McCluhan seems to be emphasizing that everything we interact with or create is a reflection of human creativity. But a lot of times the processes to get there (such as how long it took for humans to make the wheel or railroad) are long and drawn out. However, despite this the "mediums" can "accelerate or amplify" everyday processes such as movement and creativity."
- "The author seems to bring up the argument of Narcissus style or trance quite a few times throughout the reading. I would be interested in reading more about this. A quick google search, no one source in particular, showed that McLuhan has quite a few papers on this concept. I would be interested to look into the Narcissus trance in relation to modern day problems people are having with AI, such as AI psychosis is this related in some way??"
- "I agree with Abby on this. Some professors are so opposed to any type of technology that they refuse to let you use those things. Normally they will say something along the lines of, "you need to know how to do it yourselves" or "the citation machines are not going to have what you need to cite and all the effort you put into creating the citation on the website you could have just made the citation in your paper."
- "I totally agree with you about desire and fantasy being connected to new technology. I also think it ties directly into McLuhan's point that technologies are extensions of us and may bring psychic and social consequences. I am pretty sure when motorcars and TVs first became popular, they were originally adopted by the wealthy and successful, symbols of status. Which created cycles of demand from everyone else (stemming from imagination). Because of that it is as if producers, manufacturers, and the wealthy manipulate desire, while the medium reshapes how everyday people think of success and belonging (social consequences)."
### Annotations "Technology and History: “Kranzberg’s Laws"
"Summary of Kranzbergs Laws:

1. Technology is not inherently anything (good, bad, neutral). Its meaning and impact depend on who is using it and how it is being used.

2. The more we invent the more we need to improve. This creates a cycle of creativity and innovation.

3. Technologies advancement toward success is due, in part, by interconnected systems all of which rely on one another. If you improve one part of the system you’ll need to improve the rest.

4. Decisions regarding technology are dominated by economic discourse and opinions of the wealthy, despite not being the most functional or optimal for the people.

5. The history of technology is the most relevant, due to its impact. An understanding of the past will allow us to understand the future and present better.

6. Technology is made for humans by humans therefore technology is a purely human result of innovation.

I find myself agreeing with the first, fourth, and sixth laws. The idea that technology itself is not good, bad, or neutral, rather shaped by human use and how it is used. The first law goes hand in hand with the fourth law. The fourth also stands out to me because, so much of technological development is driven by those with wealth and influence. One example, I can think of is the lightbulb industry; when long lasting lightbulbs were first invented manufacturers of the lightbulbs collectively agreed to shorten their lifespan so that they did not go out of business. This decision benefitted those producing the light bulbs but took away from the rest of society. Finally, the sixth law shows the main truth of technology. That technology is human. Technology reflects our creativity, intentions, motives and beliefs it mirrors who we are.

If you want to know more about the lightbulb situation The Uneasy Case of Programmed Obsolescence by Pierre-Emmanuel Moyse is a really good free paper on it."






# Week 2 fail log
## Summary of my experience
This week we are focusing on library research and literature reviewing utilizing three things:
- Research Rabbit
- Google Scholar
- University Library Resources
## Struggles and Successes
## Research Rabbit:
- I struggled a bit with Research Rabbit. I could not figure out how to exit after I posted a new article in the shared collection. The answer was right in front of my eyes. If I hovered over the section on the right (1 selected paper) an X would appear and I would be able to exit back to the main page. I reread the materials and watched the video and was able to figure it out.

- Another skill I learned was how to add articles to shared collections on Research Rabbit. I added the article "Addendum: The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (2019)" because the originial article "The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (2016)" was in the collection already. From my understanding an Addendum is an addition or revision going into more detail from previous work, so I thought that it was important to include the addendum from the original article in the collection. Research Rabbit utilizes a similar work feature. This feature shows you similar work to the article or collection you are working on. I have added the before and after images of the similar work section, which show the difference between the section before and after I added the article to the collection. You can really see a difference between the two.

## Google Scholar
- This week I compared Google Scholar to Microsoft Bing, both of which I am familiar with so I was easily able to navigate I googled "Open Data Archeology" on both of the platforms and there were some noticable differences. On Microsoft Bing there were a lot more open data centers where I could go to get or publish data, which would facilitate actual use of data for research. On Google Scholar there were research articles where I could read about open data and the importance of it in archaeology. I would use Microsoft Bing if I was looking for actual data or wanted to publish some data, while I would use Google Scholar to do research or write about the importance of open data in archaeology.
### Microsoft Bing
<img width="519" height="332" alt="anth week 2 bing 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/629b1c65-e9e0-4574-b935-4fb9a8a815a2" />

### Google Scholar
<img width="482" height="620" alt="anth week 2 google scholar" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3fe8d58-cdb7-4f42-8b1d-47a9b6116339" />

## University Library Resource
- This week I watch videos kindly provided by our university librarian in regards to our universitys library. I was happy to see that the universitys library website works with zotero, which I have used for other classes. One thing I learned this week from the videos is that I can just input key words into the search. In the past, I had always done phrases or sentences and it seems like key words is an easier way to navigate the website.
- I have always preferred Google Scholar to the library website and I still believe that holds true. But, I will continue to use my university account to gain access to otherwise locked articles on Google Scholar
### Progress on my struggles from last week
I have become more literate when utilizing GitHub and Persuall. Although, I am still working on certain aspects for markdowns. For example, I am trying to add a footnote to my blog post for the week and it is not neccesarily working how it is meant to. I have finally figured it out!! I had not been including the semicolon on the second part of the footnote. 
I feel way more comfortable navigating the two with a bit of practice and experience.
## What to work on
- Brainstorming ideas for how I can incorporate Research Rabbit into my current research.
- Continue to become more literate using Persuall and GitHub.
## Reading for the Week
[Will it Ever be FAIR](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/will-it-ever-be-fair/9073D28A74C2FE87E53B3C5A7437AC74)
### Week 2 Will It Ever Be FAIR Annotations:
- "This section stood out to me because it really puts into perspective the fact that you can do your best to implement policies incorporating the FAIR and Care principles, but if the "stewards" of this do not take appropriate steps the whole system could be impacted"
- "Is this something that CRM firms are implementing currently or thinking about implementing? If not, if professional organizations do endorse the FAIR and CARE principles would they then be able to push/work with CRM firms to implement the principles. A sort of lead by example situation starting with the professional societies."
- "This appears to be something that graduate students, undergraduates, and professionals would all run into. Creating busy work "data munging" rather than allowing the individuals time on their research. Ultimately, taking away from the whole of anthropology. Is there a source that discusses how "data munging" impacts research throughout the entity of anthropology?"











# Week 1 fail log [1]:
## Summary of my experience
The first week in this class, I spent trying to figure out how to use GitHub, which, honestly, I am not the best at, I have encountered a lot of times where I was a bit confused setting this all up. Eventually, I gave in and googled a step due to my lack of knowledge surrounding this website. For example, I couldn't figure out how to edit, and after a couple of minutes of looking around I finally googled and learned that the way to edit these pages was right in front of my eyes... all I had to do was click the pencil icon. 
I also spent a lot of time figuring out another website called Perusall, where I am able to annotate and comment on my course readings. I did a practice comment that is linked here [Week 1 Perusall Practice Comment](https://app.perusall.com/courses/fall-2025-anthropology-of-science-and-technology-anth-410r-950/digital-anthropology-syllabus-553064581?annotationId=ZyuyYExzhnp3Qqngx.) This is important as it is helping me learn how to work Perusall and Github. I am excited to continue learning and working through some things that I do not necessarily understand. 
## Things I want to work on
Next week I hope that I am more literate in Github and Persuall. I hope that over the weekend I watch some videos on these things and educate myself more on them.
### Week 1 Syllabus Annotations:
"Excited to learn better ways to document research "fail" processes in a positive way."
