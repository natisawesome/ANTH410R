# Week 2 fail log
## Summary of my experience
This week we are focusing on library research and literature reviewing utilizing three things:
- Research Rabbit
- Google Scholar
- University Library Resources
## Struggles and Successes
## Research Rabbit:
- I struggled a bit with Research Rabbit. I could not figure out how to exit after I posted a new article in the shared collection. The answer was right in front of my eyes. If I hovered over the section on the right an X would appear and I would be able to exit back to the main page. I reread the materials and watched the video and was able to figure it out.

- Another skill I learned was how to add articles to shared collections on Research Rabbit. I added the article "Addendum: The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (2019)" because the originial article "The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (2016)" was in the collection already. From my understanding an Addendum is an addition or revision going into more detail from previous work, so I thought that it was important to include the addendum from the original article in the collection. Research Rabbit utilizes a similar work feature. This feature shows you similar work to the article or collection you are working on. I have added the before and after images of the similar work section, which show the difference between the section before and after I added the article to the collection. You can really see a difference between the two.

## Google Scholar
- This week I compared Google Scholar to Microsoft Bing. I googled "Open Data Archeology" on both of the platforms and there were some noticable differences. On Microsoft Bing there were a lot more open data centers where I could go to get or publish data, which would facilitate actual use of data for research. On Google Scholar there were research articles where I could read about open data and the importance of it in archaeology. I would use Microsoft Bing if I was looking for actual data or wanted to publish some data, while I would use Google Scholar to do research or write about the importance of open data in archaeology.
### Microsoft Bing

### Google Scholar

 Then start a new line to go back to 'regular' font). In this section, write briefly about what you found when looking on both types of search engines. What sorts of sources did Google Scholar find? What did the other search engine find. In what instances might another source be better? 
### Progress on my struggles from last week
I have become more literate when utilizing GitHub and Persuall. Although, I am still working on certain aspects for markdowns. For example, I am trying to add a footnote to my blog post for the week and it is not neccesarily working how it is meant to. I feel way more comfortable navigating the two with a bit of practice and experience.
## What to work on
## Reading for the Week
[Will it Ever be FAIR](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/will-it-ever-be-fair/9073D28A74C2FE87E53B3C5A7437AC74)
### Week 2 Will It Ever Be FAIR Annotations:
- "This section stood out to me because it really puts into perspective the fact that you can do your best to implement policies incorporating the FAIR and Care principles, but if the "stewards" of this do not take appropriate steps the whole system could be impacted"
- "Is this something that CRM firms are implementing currently or thinking about implementing? If not, if professional organizations do endorse the FAIR and CARE principles would they then be able to push/work with CRM firms to implement the principles. A sort of lead by example situation starting with the professional societies."
- "This appears to be something that graduate students, undergraduates, and professionals would all run into. Creating busy work "data munging" rather than allowing the individuals time on their research. Ultimately, taking away from the whole of anthropology. Is there a source that discusses how "data munging" impacts research throughout the entity of anthropology?"











# Week 1 fail log
## Summary of my experience
The first week in this class, I spent trying to figure out how to use GitHub, which, honestly, I am not the best at, I have encountered a lot of times where I was a bit confused setting this all up. Eventually, I gave in and googled a step due to my lack of knowledge surrounding this website. For example, I couldn't figure out how to edit, and after a couple of minutes of looking around I finally googled and learned that the way to edit these pages was right in front of my eyes... all I had to do was click the pencil icon. 
I also spent a lot of time figuring out another website called Perusall, where I am able to annotate and comment on my course readings. I did a practice comment that is linked here [Week 1 Perusall Practice Comment](https://app.perusall.com/courses/fall-2025-anthropology-of-science-and-technology-anth-410r-950/digital-anthropology-syllabus-553064581?annotationId=ZyuyYExzhnp3Qqngx.) This is important as it is helping me learn how to work Perusall and Github. I am excited to continue learning and working through some things that I do not necessarily understand. 
## Things I want to work on
Next week I hope that I am more literate in Github and Persuall. I hope that over the weekend I watch some videos on these things and educate myself more on them.
### Week 1 Syllabus Annotations:
"Excited to learn better ways to document research "fail" processes in a positive way."
