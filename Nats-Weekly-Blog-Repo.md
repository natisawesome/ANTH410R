# Introduction
Hi, I am Nat a current undergraduate student in anthropology. My passions in anthropology are bioarcaeology and forensic anthropology. In the future, I hope to do government work in relation to repatriation of fallen soliders, or humanitarian work to help identify and repatriate those who suffered at the hands of genocide around the world. This passion of mine was inspired by my family members who survived the holocaust, many of them did not. I hope I will be able to bring closure to families who were always left wondering what happened and where their family members ended up. This blog will follow my journey through a class that focuses on science and technology in anthropology. I'm excited to start learning!!

## Learning Goals

# Week 8
This week was a struggle with me. Although I have experience coding I am not sure why it was so difficult for me. Some of the challenges confused me and I ended up going back and redoing things multiple times until I could understand what was happening or what changed. I could benefit from more practice with R. Also now I am kind of nervous for next semester because I know we will be using that for Quantatative Analysis. Hopefully that will give me the practice I need.
Additionally, in the readings this week I felt like they are starting to be repetative of what has already been assigned as readings. I am not sure what else I can add to the conversatioin despite wanting to jump in. A lot of what I want to say I have already said in pervious readings and I do not really want to be repatative in my comments. I hope that the discussion boards on D2L start having questions again. The questions on the discussion board have resulted in some of my favorite conversations. Open ended questions about what we are doing really help me think through and understand what I am doing.

# Week 7
This week, we focused on cleaning data. I really enjoyed the readings and lecture videos, which helped me gain a better understanding of the importance of data cleaning and accessibility. The readings went into the ethical considerations surrounding the relationship between researchers and those being researched. One of the readings highlighted that written consent forms could jeopardize the safety of individuals, which is why oral consent is often preferred. Anonymity is the default in research, but if an individual is not anonymous, I believe it could be important to implement a multistep consent process at the beginning, middle, and end. This ensures that the individuals being researched understand the implications and know they can revoke consent at any time once the research has started. When individuals are not anonymous, there should be protections in place for both the researcher and the research subjects.


Additionally, in the first part of the lecture video, there was a quote: "The Data Availability Statement should identify restrictions and necessary permissions for access to data, as well as provide a plan for the free sharing of information with descendant groups while also guarding the privacy of sensitive information" - AJBA Author Guide. I feel that this quote perfectly describes our obligations as anthropologists. Personally, I hope to become a forensic anthropologist or bioarchaeologist. I have learned that my role in this field is to state facts and convey truths that already exist. I do not own any data or information; I am simply the pen that puts it on paper, much like a court reporter documenting someone else's case. Of course, I am not emotionally detached, but it is important to remember that in this field, particularly depending on one’s focus, it is not about you; it is about others and what they can share with you. The wisdom and stories an anthropologist can gather come from listening, observing, and recognizing what is already there. Without other humans or individuals willing to share their experiences, anthropology as a whole would collapse. We are the storytellers of humanity, and it is our duty to ensure that these stories are told in the most accessible and ethical way possible.
# Week 6
- This week's topic on data management made me reflect on my previous work, particularly how accessible it is to both others and myself, as well as how well it is organized. I have taken the time to consider my actions and plans in this area. As a new researcher, I realize that I need to change the way I approach this now. I need to focus on organizing my research and making it accessible, and I understand that developing good habits is crucial. I need to start creating files and sticking to them, which I have not done in the past. Everything needs metadata, and I am committed to starting that process now. I recognize that this is something I have yet to address in my research. Initially, I thought of it as a struggle, but that would imply I had actually looked into it and devoted time to it, which I haven't. That is going to change after this week. This experience has really put into perspective how much I need to catch up on for myself and for any future research. I am currently involved in grant work and have a research project this year, both of which I intend to manage and be organized as possible, starting with creating files and collecting metadata. Honestly, I feel disappointed in myself for not having started this process sooner, but I am excited to begin. This was the reality check I needed to take that first step.
- My takeaway for the week is that I didn’t realize how closely data management and accessibility are connected. After completing the activities and readings, I learned that poor data management leads to poor accessibility. This was particularly evident in the exercise we did in Perusall.
# Week 5
- When I refer to a reading I am refering to What I Wish I Knew about Anthropology and Disability: Notes toward a more enabling anthropology


This week, we examined online accessibility, focusing on aspects such as color and contrast, alt text, links, formatting, captions, and transcripts. I really enjoyed learning about these topics. In my blog post this week, I want to discuss the readings and the overall theme of accessibility and disability in anthropology.

For some context on why this is important to me: I have epilepsy and chronic migraines, which I have been dealing with along with medically diagnosed depression, anxiety, and ADHD since I was around eight years old. Although I may appear perfectly able-bodied, I am not. This topic is very important to me because I had to fight for accessibility throughout my childhood. I attended a religious private school that was not accommodating at all. I did not really want to go into detail with my disabilities on the reading annotations. I feel way better about it on this blog post.

I’d like to speak on a point made by one of my classmates during the reading discussion. They mentioned that studying disability can help us understand it, which I completely agree with; however, I do have some concerns:

1. Anthropology as a field has been absolutely obsessed with studying things that are different and exotic. I hope that when anthropology addresses disabilities, it does so without the lens of othering.

2. Many people have both visible and invisible disabilities, and I believe this issue should have been addressed and acted upon long ago. Of course, I recognize that our current political climate makes such progress challenging.

3. Given that so many individuals experience disabilities, they are in the best position to determine what solutions will work for them. One of the readings mentioned how those with disabilities often have extensive lists of what works and what doesn’t. This is completely accurate; all it takes is asking rather than assuming.

Creating an accessible, open, and safe space may seem like an impossible task, but I do not believe that it is. One reason my discussion post focused on "The Bioarchaeology of Care" is that I thought it effectively addressed issues of disability and accessibility. This shows that disability and accessability are not something new, but have been around for centuries. If we find evidence that humans have cared for those with disabilities, illnesses, injuries, and old age for centuries, why can’t we do the same today? What is so difficult about providing and creating access for other human beings?

Sidenote: I have not looked into this it is just something I think about. I feel like the terms "disabled" and "differently abled" serve as a way for people who are fully abled to distance themselves from those who have disabilities. However, I believe this should not be the case. According to one of the readings, 1 in 6 Americans has some form of disability. That includes our friends, mothers, cousins, sisters, brothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. Disability should not be something that others are distanced from; after all, how can you distance yourself from your friends and family? I wish there were a different term to describe this experience because I do not see myself as disabled. I simply require different accommodations to level the playing field. For instance, when I get a migraine and I am unable to get out of bed or even look at light for a week, it is not due to lack of effort or motivation. I physically cannot do it. When I receive an extension on a paper or an assignment, it's not about giving me extra time; it’s about allowing me the same amount of time my classmates had to complete the work. This is a part of who I am and my life. It will not hold me back as long as I have the accessibility and accommodations that create an equal environment. I am grateful to my university for their support; they are truly the best.

Meaning of accessability is equality and equal environments for all.


# Week 4
Throughout this week, I have been using Joplin as a method of note-taking specifically for this class. I find it easier to translate my notes from Joplin to GitHub. I tried using Joplin for some of my other classes and even for personal tasks, like my grocery list, but I found it was just easier to do those things in OneNote. I really enjoy using both OneNote and Joplin, but for the concept of markdowns and accessibility across platforms, I prefer Joplin for this class where I am using GitHub. It creates a nice connection between my notes, my blog, and my fail log.

In the future, I still see myself using OneNote for the majority of things. However, before I chose anthropology, I had an interest in robotics during high school, which led me to take several classes in Java and Python. Coding has a special place in my heart, so I might be biased in that regard. There was also a time when I was programming bots on Discord, setting up servers, and getting paid well for it. Because of this background, the concept of markdowns truly holds a special place in my heart. Using a translatable and accessible way to take notes or keep track of information is not only satisfying but also nostalgic for me.

I want to add that I absolutely loved the readings this week. I feel that field notes and ethnographies aren't really taught in depth, and it often ends up being a trial and error process for students. As I mentioned in the discussion and comments on the readings, I wrote an ethnography a couple of summers ago, and I really enjoyed it. During that time, I was figuring out my approach to writing. I highly recommend the book *Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes* by Robert Emerson. It's an amazing resource that I used as my guide for writing field notes. I hope that field notes and the process of how we take them become a larger topic in anthropology as a whole, rather than expecting students to know or just throwing them in at the deep end to figure it out themselves. While I agree that field notes can be quite personal to anthropologists, I believe that this approach may need to change. Making field notes and the process of turning them into academically publishable work could benefit not just students but the field of anthropology as a whole. I believe transparency and accessibility are crucial for maintaining objectivity and impartiality, especially given anthropology's history.
# Week 3
- This week I explored citation management software. I found the content for this week really overwhelming for some reason, and it took me a bit of time to start it. Once I did I realized I was going to have to make some changes to how I am going about this class and my learning style. I took notes on paper and online to figure out what the best way to take notes in this class was. I quickly found out that to synthesize the video and readings, which I really enjoyed but were rather long, I was going to have to start writing down my thoughts in an easy way. I think from now on I am going to have a running word document going, as I found that was the most helpful way to do things this week. Although, I normally prefer paper it was just easy to have online notes. Being able to draw from my notes on a specific topic directly to writing an annotation or discussion post was easier for me than going tab to tab. The jumping between tabs for me was really rough this week and it was just easier for me to copy paste the question into my word document and than write my response there where I have easy access to my notes and comments.
- "We also chose and added to a library on Zotero where I added three citations. When choosing citations, I read the abstract for my first reference, Digitisation: Theories and Concepts for Empirical Cultural Research. There is a specific chapter, "Ludification of culture: The significance of play and games in everyday practices of the digital era,"(Koch 2017), which I was drawn to in the context of analyzing the anthropology of video games. The next citation I chose was Archaeogaming: An Introduction to Archaeology in and of Video Games (Reinhard 2018). I am currently playing a game called Palia, which has a whole plot line revolving around archaeology. I thought this was a fascinating paper, and when I have the time, I am definitely going to read it. My third citation lacked an abstract; instead, it provided a PDF of the completed work, Religion in Digital Games (Heidbrink n.d.), which summarized the evolution of religion in video games over time. I chose this because it seemed interesting." (This is directly from my paper for the week) (Eves 2025)
## Next Weeks Introduction + Hopes and Dreams for the Week
-  I am super excited for next weeks topic, because it is on notetaking and I think that is exactly the type of thing that I need to work on and add to my skills. I feel like this week would have been easier if I had already established a place where I was taking notes specifically for this class. Experimenting this week really showed me what I prefered for this class; despite usually prefering hand written its definitly easier to just do online notes for this class.
### Sidenote Week 3:
- I will say that I have had bad luck this past week of multiple family emergencies that resulted in the loss of more than one family member and the hospitalization of another, paired with what seems to be short term technology incompetence on my end. So I definitly think a majority of the things that I struggled with were due to outside influences not neccesarily the work in itself.
## Questions
### Magical Thinking Seminar Questions:
If I feel that technology reflects humanity; it essentially mirrors us. 
- So, does that mean technology is human, or is it rather a byproduct of our creativity and ingenuity? 
- If you take the phrase “I think, therefore I am” and AI can essentially think to the point we cannot differentiate between human and AI is AI human?
- What constitues being?
- How do you differantiate humans being from things created from humans being?
### Medium is the Message Questions
- Is the Narcissus Trance mentioned by the author related to the modern day problem of AI psychosis? 
- Where if technology mirrors humans it agrees with them so much that it drives them further and further down the rabbit hole of psychosis??
# Week 2
This week I explored Library Research and Literature Review tools. This exploration included Research Rabbit, Google Scholar, and my schools online library. As I was familirizing myself with these tools I realized that I prefered certain tools over others, and in discussion this week one of my peers (PVM) pointed out that Research Rabbit does a lot of things that Google Scholar does. I whole heartedly agree with this. After exploring, I feel like Google Scholar is the "old" while Research Rabbit is the "new". Research Rabbit allows you to see timelines, connections, and similar articles compared to the sources or articles that you are using. This can save students and professionals a lot of time that they would otherwise spend "data munging" [^1] when they are doing research. Rather than be hunting for articles and not finding anything they are automatically recommended to you. But I will still be using other tools such as Google Scholar and my universitys library to find articles as well. 
## Questions
Research Rabbit does generate some questions from me about how the recommendations work. 
- Are certain articles going to be recommended more than others? 
- How unbiased is Research Rabbit? 
- Have there been any times where it should be recommending something but it is not?
- What is being used to create the generations? 
# Week 1
I followed all the directions that I was provided and have also been reading the extra information that has been linked. My favorite helpful links that were provided for Github specifically are: [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) This week has also shown me that even though things appear unfamiliar, it will be okay, no matter what with the support of my peers and the instructions provided by my instructor I will be able to figure out how to work new things. Additionally, even if I do not get it on the first try that reviewing the instructions and using my sources I will get closer to the answer in my next couple of trys.
