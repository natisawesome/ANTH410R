# Week 8
This week was a struggle with me. Although I have experience coding I am not sure why it was so difficult for me. Some of the challenges confused me and I ended up going back and redoing things multiple times until I could understand what was happening or what changed. I could benefit from more practice with R. Also now I am kind of nervous for next semester because I know we will be using that for Quantatative Analysis. Hopefully that will give me the practice I need.
Additionally, in the readings this week I felt like they are starting to be repetative of what has already been assigned as readings. I am not sure what else I can add to the conversatioin despite wanting to jump in. A lot of what I want to say I have already said in pervious readings and I do not really want to be repatative in my comments. I hope that the discussion boards on D2L start having questions again. The questions on the discussion board have resulted in some of my favorite conversations. Open ended questions about what we are doing really help me think through and understand what I am doing.
