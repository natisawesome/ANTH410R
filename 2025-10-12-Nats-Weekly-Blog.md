# Week 9
This week, we focused on audio manipulation, specifically using Audacity, conducting interviews, and creating a sound map. Honestly, I really enjoyed this week despite the challenges I faced. I completed my sound map early in the week and found a lot of peace in the process. 

Later in the week, around Wednesday or Thursday, I confirmed and conducted my interview regarding a family recipe. Lizzy (a pseudonym) is one of my good friends, and her family has a pie crust recipe that has been passed down for generations. Our conversation looked into this personal and private topic, which resulted in some pauses and restarts during the interview. In fact, I ended up interviewing them over multiple days, believing that would be best for both of us, as it was very private and emotional for them.

Although I have conducted many interviews and even completed ethnographic work, this particular interview allowed me to practice the principles we had been discussing concerning anonymity and how to protect the interviewee. Lizzy initially approved the idea of me sharing the interview with the class, but later requested that I only use a small clip with her permission. If the professor requests the full interview, I can send it, but I won’t be sharing it publicly. This experience really showed me the importance of consent in ethnography, reinforcing my belief that consent in ethnography can be revoked at any time for the safety and security of the individual being interviewed.

Additionally, while I attempted to edit the interview using Audacity, I encountered technical difficulties. The program would not accept the voice memo in any format I saved it in, so I had to find a workaround. I tried using Microsoft Clipchamp, which also posed problems, but I attribute that to my own struggles with technology. Overall, I feel I learned a lot and gained firsthand knowledge of the topics we have been discussing. Ethnography, the words, sounds, stories, and emotions we take from them, do not belong to us as anthropologists to manipulate at will; rather, they belong to those we interview. Ethnography is like using a microscope to examine intimate aspects of people’s lives that are not often discussed in such depth. When we look closely, we can observe every little detail. It’s vital that we guard and protect these stories, remembering that we are merely the storytellers. It is not our place to take control but to respect those whose stories, emotions, and lives we analyze with a microscope.
