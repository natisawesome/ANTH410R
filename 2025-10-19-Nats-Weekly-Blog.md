# Week 10
I don't have much to say about this week's exercises other than that I enjoyed them immensely. The social media activity was great, as was the meme making. I spent some time thinking about the meme throughout the week, trying to decide what had been most meaningful to me in the class so far. 

I believe the data management plan unit has been particularly impactful. I’ve done research before, but I never considered the importance of having a data management plan; I was simply unaware of it. Now, I have a data management plan for my research, and I’ve also stayed very organized with my files, writing everything down. I can't stress enough how much these improvements have enhanced the quality of my work.

Overall, the meme allowed me to reflect on the class, which I think is really important to do from time to time. With all the valuable things we are learning, it’s nice to take a calm week to think about how I have improved based on what I’ve learned and how I’ve implemented those improvements.
