## Summary of my Experience
Social Media Outreach 

### Social Media  
I really like this week's social media focus. I follow a lot of anthropologists and archaeologists on my social media, so it was easy to find something that interested me. I absolutely love watching content from Steph the Archaeologist, so I had to give her a shoutout. I also enjoyed making the meme this week; it was an awesome exercise

# Readings

## Bioarchaeology and the Media:Anthropology Scicomm in a Post-TruthLandscape
### comments
- I feel like in anthropology this would be difficult to achieve. Defining your audience would be especially difficult. The way that articles are written is not necessarily accessible to the general public so you would first have to reassess how the information is getting to the public and then define your audience. However, like we have all seen with the social media there are a lot of anthropologists who spread information about what they are doing. I think this is a really good way to reach people
- Exactly!! If an anthropologist wanted to focus on writing which the general public could understand it would not be accepted as academic. This "publish-or-perish mentality" makes it extremely difficult for anthropology to branch out and become more prevalent to the public. Those who would be best to teach the public about anthropology and the importance of what is studied in the field are trapped in the academic red tape
- I agree with you. I do not think this would be trivial. Especially if a larger organization started one.

## Anthropology, Empathy,and the Need for SocialScience Communication
### comments
- I have had multiple people ask me if anthropology is the study of ants. I agree that this field needs more exposure and representation to our society
- I had never heard about a science communication teaching and research programs before. I would be interested to see what could happen if social sciences were included in that. I believe it would probably fix our lack of exposure, allowing for more discourse about what anthropologists can bring understanding to.

# Discussion Post

## Social Media:

I follow Steph the Archaeologists on Facebook who makes short content form posts about what she is doing. This week she is in Istanbul. I really enjoyed learning about Byzantine history in Istanbul. Steph showed the ancient city of Constantinople and taught her followers about the aqueduct of Valens. She also taught us about the church of Saint Polyeuctus and the Theodoseus forum. The church of Saint Polyeuctus was the largest church in Constantinople before Hagia Sophia was built. I really enjoy Stephs content because it teaches a lot about history and blends in archaeology. 

## Meme:

My meme is from Lord of the Rings. I chose this because I am a big fan of Lord of the Rings. The caption reads, "One does not simply do anthropological research without a data management plan." This is because I feel like I learned a lot from the data management plan unit on the importance of having data management plans. Therefore, I thought it was fitting to use one of my favorite book and movie series to say something about the need for a data management plan in anthropological research.

# Week 9 fail log
## Summary of my Experience
Audio Recording an Manipulation

### Audacity 
Audacity gave me a bit of trouble at first because I didn’t realize I had to download multiple components to get it to work. However, once I did, the process became pretty straightforward. I recorded my interview on my phone using Voice Memos, but it wouldn’t accept any of the file formats I tried to convert it to. I’m not sure why that was the case, but I was able to experiment with the practice file provided in class this week. 

I really liked using Audacity, and I think that next time, I will be more aware of what file types it does and does not accept. I can definitely see myself using this software in the future; it seems quite in-depth and reminds me of a system I used in a cinema class for video projects, although I can’t quite remember its name. Overall, Audacity is definitely user-friendly and perfect for projects like this.
## What to Work on for Next Week
- Start final project

# Readings

## An Artificial Environment is Often a Noisy Environment: Auditory SceneAnalysis and Speech Perception in Noise
### comments
- I use white noise as well for something in the background. It's interesting that they choose to use that for this study.

## Seeing, Hearing, FeelingSound and the Despotism of the Eyein “Visual” Anthropology
### comments
- I totally agree with you. This gives us such a good description. A lot of this reading has reminded me of a trend I have seen in popular media, especially around Halloween. It is where people put random music to horror movie scenes and then say the only reason it was scary was because of the sound. Sound gives us such an atmosphere and almost transports us to the moment we are seeing on the screen or hearing. It is a way that we can connect with others experiences and I think that a lack of sound is just as important.

## Hearing Cultures 1-20
### comments
- I am glad that this is being mentioned. I think with a lot of the topics discussed in the readings about sound medicine is overlooked. Sound and what we expose ourselves to can be healing, which just goes to show how important sound is to convey things
-  I really like your take on this. These are such important questions to ask and consider for an accessible and equal field of anthropology
-  I just want to say in general I love the concept of "hearing cultures." I feel like anthropology as a whole talks so much about observation but neglects hearing. Rather sight, taste, and smell are primary senses in many ethnographies. I wonder if there are readings on anthropological ethnography which emphasize the use of all the senses and teach students how to do so without favoring one? I would be interested to try out a method like that.



# Week 8 fail log
## Summary of my Experience
Introduction to R

### R
Honestly, I really struggled with some of the challenges of this unit. I do not like R very much or I need much more practice using R. I think it is a really good data tool though and I can understand the importance of knowing it exists and using it in applicable research. I would be intrested in maybe watching some videos on R. 
I wonder if there is a way to link R up in such a way that it would be similar to an excel workbook. Where you can have one master sheet and when you update that it updates all the little ones or vice versa. It would be intresting if you could just query that data from one location.
## What to Work on for Next Week
- Solidify date to start final project

# Readings

## Is This the End of Anthropology as We Know It? SomeImplication of FAIR Principles on Tales in Ethnological andAnthropological Qualitative Research
### comments
- I really like this point. Finding and working with "interlocutors" is sort of an "initiation process" within the field. This process teaches people that the data and research is not just data and research; the data represents little parts of people lives and history. Without firsthand understanding of the process, it may be difficult to grasp the meaning of data and why open access with the permission of the interlocutor or confidentiality per the request of the interlocutor is vital.
- Honestly, this has been something on my mind recently in terms of accessibility. This statistic shows that 90.9% of the anthropologists interviewed said they share research via "scientific papers, book chapters, or something similar". That is a HUGE amount. This does not seem accessible to the general public, just academic scholars. Many of the individuals who we get our research from are members of the general public rather than academic scholars. Are scientific fields taking steps to make their research and data more accessible and readable to the general public, without the academic jargon or the intimidation that comes with heavily academic articles and books? Would accessible data in general also be considering ways to make data more accessible not only for researchers but also for anyone interested and those who we work with to gain the data in the first place?
##  Data sharing in biological anthropology: Guiding principlesand best practices
### comments
- Yes! I think it is really important to remember this. Especially the next part of the quote that discusses a conversation about a consenting process.

# Week 7 fail log
## Summary of my Experience
This week we are focusing on Data Cleaning. 

### Data Dictionary
This activity confused me. I understand the importance of having a data dictionary it was just hard for me to create one without real data/examples. I am such a visual learner that to create my own I would need my own data to input. The example provided really helped. I had never heard of variable coding values/flags in regards to anthropological data before. Additionally, I have used data dictionaries before. I learned about them this summer during the fieldschool. I was able to assist in inputting artifact information into the data dictionary, as well as assist in other research. I forgot what it is called but theres a way to link multiple excell sheets into one big sheet that updates every time you update the individual sheets which are linked to it. In the future, I hope to learn more about data dictionaries and create my own. 
### Open Refine
I found this as a really good way to store data. It is just simple coding once again. However, I would stick with excel over this. There are many steps and intricacies that you need to understand how to work this tool. I have been using excel since I was a kid and it is just familiar to me.

# Readings

## Guidelines for anthropological research: Data management, ethics, and integrity
### comments
- I disagree with that. It generally requires considerable effort to find out who is being discussed unless additional identifying information is included in the research. It is not a "workable solution" because of how many details get omitted to protect the identity of the individual.
- I agree. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about written consent. From the perspective of anonymity, I would prefer to take oral consent; however, if someone does not want to remain anonymous, I would want written consent at the beginning and end of the research. Only if this would not put the individual at risk in anyway. 
Before I publish, I would ensure that I obtain another written consent form to confirm that the individual still does not want to be anonymous. Perhaps we could implement a multi-step confirmation process to maintain the trust of individuals involved. This process should be included in the consent forms so that individuals know they have the option to revoke consent at any time, therefore reverting back to anonymity. The default option should be anonymity, and if someone prefers not to be anonymous, that is where written consent would be necessary for their safety and the safety of the researchers.
##  Data management in anthropology: the next phase in ethics governance?
### comments
- Yes!!! Without this understanding there is a clear disconnect between the researcher and the researched. To not understand this is to not understand your duty as an anthropologist. 
- I feel like this is a very important concept that some people forget about. Although they may be the researcher the data should be "owned" by the individuals the research was done on. The research is simply the pen putting it to paper not the person who created the data.
- This concept led me to a question regarding monetary gain in the context of co-owned data between the researcher and the researched. If an ethnography produced by the researcher becomes very popular and generates monetary profit, what happens then?


# Week 6 fail log
## Summary of my Experience
This week we are focusing on Data Managment. Specifically:
- Data Management Plans (DMP)
- Organization
- Security
- Metadata
## Data Management Plans
Data Management plans are comprised of information such as data collection, documentation and metadata, ethics and legal compliance, storage and backup, selection and preservation, data sharing, responsibilities and resources, and outcome. This essentially puts the plan for your research in one place creating a guide you can refer to during the data collection and research process. I really liked this activity, although I will say it took a lot of time. I used my current research as the example. Although, I will say that I found myself repeating myself a lot in the DMP. The questions felt very repetative especially for someone with a research project that is not as indepth as practiced researchers.

## Organization
During the folder and filename activity I realized I need to be better at creating files. I looked back at my previous research and instead of it being in one folder together it was all scattered saved in different areas. I did save it physically and online in multiple places. One thing I can improve on would definitely be organization. So I have made a plan for my current research and grant work.
- Log everything in a word document
- have a page with sources and links
- Create a file for all of the items I use for the research


## Security
I feel confident in security. My passwords are all different and I have all of my research in secure places. I also use two factor identification, and have multiple backups of my worok that I continuously update. I would say I passed that safety and security test.


## Metadata
Recently, I have started to keep metadata. I am working on a grant that is ArcGIS Pro and that is very important in ArcGIS Pro. I think that this is still something I could improve on. I am going to keep working on my notes and continue to add metadata to all of my work. 

## What to Work on for Next Week
Next week I want to continue working through all of my files and put them in appropriate folders. I also want to keep working with GitHub on making my faillog and blog more cohesive.

# Readings

## Introduction: Towards ananthropology of data
### comments
- I really like this phrase, "data's ubiquity and polysemy," because it shows how data is used in almost everything but in different ways.
- I really like this idea as well. I think it makes a lot of sense to further understand those providing data.
- I agree with you. I think overdetermine if the wrong word. If anything it should be underdetermine. Solely because of what it could be

##  The datafication of nature: dataformations and new scales innatural history
### comments
- I really like the picture this paints us. It reminds me a lot of curatorial work in anthropology. Being stuck between past (what the artifacts are currently), present (what the artifacts are becoming), and future (what the artifacts will be). As artifacts are digitized, they exist in a state of transition, suspended in a "multidimensional modernizing process". Curators and technology together transform them into something new, making them accessible to anyone interested and elevating their visibility in ways we haven't seen before.


## Exercise: Reusing qualitative data: the value of context
### comments
- How does perception of health, familial relations and cultural norms, impact eating healthy.
- Information such as age, location, time, and status of the individuals would all help better understand the extracts.
- Age, location, time period, and the status of the individuals are important factors that provide essential context. Understanding these elements, such as whether individuals are older or younger, the era they belong to, their status, and their geographic location will greatly enhance the ability to interpret their responses and the questions they are asked. Without this context, meaningful interpretation is difficult, and the information cannot be effectively used in research.
# Week 5 fail log
## Summary of my Experience
This week we are focusing on accesability. Specifically:
- Links
- Color and Contrast
- Formatting
- Captions and Transcrips
- Alt-Text
## Struggles and Successes
### Links
I found this part for this week super easy. I was able to talk about The Bioarcheology of Care. That is one of my favorite topics in anthropology. I will say for some reason embedding the links on D2L took a couple tries. I had to edit my post to fix them, but in the end I got it. 


### Color and Contrast
I really liked this activity as well. It took a while for me to find a color combination that actually passed the AA standards, but once I did it passed both AA and AAA. I learned a lot in this section. I feel like I do not normally thing about if a power point or presentation has unaccesable colors. This is because I usually use a black and white color scheme. This has definitely put things into perspective for me and I will be checking my presentations now with. 

[Web Accessibility Checker](https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/)


### Formatting
I liked this section as well. This is definitly one thing I already do. I really like to have accessable table of contents just for myself on my writing platforms such as word. Having a table of contents makes my life so much easier especially when doing research.


### Captions and Transcrips
This was one of my least favorite sections. This is only due to the fact that I am not technologically savvy. I really struggled to figure this out. I was using Cap Cut which is basically video editing in the frame of programs such as tik tok, musically, and vine. So I was definitly familiar with it. Getting the video from Cap Cut to D2L was a struggle for me. My D2L on my laptop will not accept anything from my non school outlook account, which is all I have on my laptop. I normally turn things in one my phone from my school account. But that it just a personal issue and I was able to figure out how to get it on D2L properly, by using a work around with Microsofts video editor and saving that on my school account there. 


### Alt-Text
This was my absolute least favorite one. Not for lack of ease, but I could not think of an artifact for the life of me so it took the longest. I finally came up with something that related to one of my previous classes and had to reeducate myself on it. Luckily I take digital notes on One Note and was able to go back and find information like the date. Honestly, it was a trip down memory lane, despite my lack of brain storming it was nice to review these things. I also really like using Alt-Text on presentations and posters. I definitely learned a lot more about Alt-Text than what I knew and I will happily apply that information in the future. (Knowing when to mark something as decorative vs knowing when to apply alt-text.)


## Discussion
### Progress on my Struggles from Last Week
Nothing new to report. I have been thinking about using Zotero and Research Rabbit to do my research. I have not started yet so I have no update on that. Once I do start I will report back. I feel really comfortable using Perusall. I have started to star conversations that I am apart of just so its easier for me to jump back and forth between my conversations.
### What to Work on for Next Week
- Keep practicing new skills
- Make my work accessible

For some reason, I did not see the What is Accessability to you discussion section so I did not do it on time. I did it Monday when I noticed. So next week I want to make sure I do not miss anything and triple check all the disucssion boards, before I think my work is complete. I just assumed it was the discussion we had previously done for the activites and it was something different, so that is definitely on me for not being more thorough with my class work


## Readings 
- What I Wish I Knew about Anthropology and Disability: Notes toward a more enabling anthropology
- Disruption at the Center: Disability Anthropology and Black Feminist Research-Creation
### Annotations of What I Wish I Knew about Anthropology and Disability: Notes toward a more enabling anthropology
- I agree that there is a lot to learn from different societies on this topic. Disabilities are a part of everyday life for many people. According to the statistics on page 10, "37% of academics have a mental health disorder, 20% of Americans are disabled, 1 in 6 Americans take psychiatric medications, and nearly 70% of Americans take some form of prescription drug." The issues and experiences we are discussing are far from uncommon. Given that 1 in 6 Americans face these challenges, I find it hard to understand why accessibility isn't considered the norm.
- Honestly, this does not "flirt with the unethical" it is unethical. As someone with an unseen disability this is so sad to see. That rather than addressing the issue the first thing that was done was blaming the person for a disability they have no control over.
- This is so real. Just ask what accommodations work best rather than assuming.
### Annotations of Disruption at the Center: Disability Anthropology and Black Feminist Research-Creation
- Yes!! That is what I thought of as well.
- I totally agree with this. The "border-policing practices" are something that have been an issue in anthropology. That acknowledging anthropologists should not be bound to one "object" or "method" is important in accessibility within the field

# Week 4 fail log
## Summary of my experience
This week we are focusing on note-taking tools.
- Joplin
- OneNote
- Paper
## Struggles and Successes
### Onenote
I currently use OneNote and link it to Word documents as needed, but it's not my absolute favorite way to take notes. I prefer handwriting my notes because I learn better that way. However, OneNote is certainly useful. It allows you to link notebooks to Word documents, and I appreciate that it lets you create a notebook with multiple pages. I like to dedicate one page a week per class for my notes. 

OneNote has many features and provides a lot of space on each page, so you can write as much as you need without any issues. I'm also partial to OneNote because if you use the Control + F function in a notebook, it will search through all the pages, making it easier to find something specific without having to sift through each page manually.

Overall, I really like OneNote. The only negative aspect I would mention is the image formatting. I often struggle with inserting images, as it sometimes creates an extra box or fails to create one when needed, which can make things messy. However, this may be more about my own lack of technological know how, rather than OneNote itself.
### Joplin
I wanted to try out a new type of note-taking that is more accessible and translatable to GitHub, so I looked into note-taking apps that work with markdowns. I discovered an app called Joplin.

I actually really like Joplin because it offers a user-friendly way to format your notes without needing to memorize markdown characters for specific tasks. It has buttons for bold, italics, and other formatting options, making it simple to use. Additionally, Joplin provides a comprehensive explanation of markdown and includes a welcome guide that walks you through it step by step. 

One of my favorite features is the side-by-side view of your markdown and regular notes. This way, I can see what my notes will look like as I type, rather than committing changes and discovering later that I've made formatting mistakes. Once I'm done typing, there's an option in the upper right corner to view just the notes, which is fantastic. 

Overall, I really like this interface and how it works. It's similar to OneNote or Word documents, which I typically use for most of my classes. I like the idea of notebooks and pages, but Joplin offers the same concept with markdown support.

Also, I was struggling to get my GitHub to format seperate paragraphs or sentences properly without use of a bullet point, if I copy paste from Joplin it formats exactly the same as on Joplin. From now on that is how I will be doing my notes.

<img width="868" height="754" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/111bfaaf-1d81-4924-b9f4-5328c984c081" />


Sidenote: In the welcome guide Joplin provides they shout out GitHub.


<img width="282" height="204" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e43d4946-a2ec-482f-83d1-f612984e0fce" />

---

Joplin Update: I started this form of note taking at the beginning of the week on Sunday. It is now Friday. I think that I really like Joplin. You honestly do not even have to type the markdowns in. You can just type your regular notes and use the heading, bold, italic, etc. buttons and it will markdown and format everything automatically. It is also formatted like OneNote with the notebooks and pages so it is super easy to stay organized. I would definitly recommend this to anyone who wants more universally accesable notes or notes that use markdowns in general.

### Paper 
 want to give a shout-out to this style of note-taking that I really love. However, there are a few downsides. Unfortunately, when a professor is going quickly, it’s much easier for me to type than to write, so I can keep up. As I mentioned in my discussion post for this week, I’m left-handed, so my notes tend to smudge A LOT. This is often challenging to address; sometimes I find pens that work for a while, but later they won't (if I order new ones or replace the ink). I’ve also realized that when I use pencils, the words can smudge so badly that I can't read them.

Although I prefer writing notes because I learn better that way, I often resort to digital platforms for note-taking. I only write on paper when I need to remember something specific or need to resolve a tab issue on my computer. I don’t really like to split-screen, so if I have to switch back and forth between readings and assignments to find quotes (since many of my other classes just scan in pages and we can’t copy and paste), I either write down the quotes or take a picture on my phone and then retype them.

I think that conversation could lead to a different discussion about open access and accessibility. It often feels like it just creates busywork for students. Anyway, I love taking notes on paper, but in this digital age, it’s just not practical to rely on that alone.
### Readings and Discussion
## Progress on my Struggles from Last Week
I looked into the idea I had about footnotes as a table of contents and unfortunatly that does not really work. But in my exploration I found some recommendations to use a type of markdown that is links and that'll help. So I messed around with that a little and I think that I just like to scroll if I need anything fromany specific week. I still have not figured out the Perusall comment situation yet... but I was able to figure out how to space out my paragraphs using GitHub. Especially if I transfer my notes and writings from joplin to GitHub I am able to do it easily.
### What to Work on 
- Continue becoming more literate using tools
- Find ways to incorporate these tools into my research
- Keep using Joplin.
## Readings for the Week
- The "Proto-Language" of Anthropological Practice
- ethnoGRAPHIC fieldnotes
### Annotations of The "Proto-Language" of Anthropological Practice
- "I took an independent study where I did an ethnography over a summer. One book I found very helpful was Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes by Robert Emerson. I highly recommended, it taught me a lot."
- "I really love the visual this gives us. Reading your own writing allows you to reflect and learn from your previous work. I have definitely done this, and it is an essential part of learning how to write fieldnotes or ethnographies. Self-reflection of our own work while considering how we can improve is a key aspect of growing and learning."
- "Yes!! When I was working on my ethnography and went back to summarize and write it up, I realized I had experienced this exact moment. It's a common part of learning how to write ethnographies and field notes. You often come to the realization that you missed certain details and may not have taken good enough notes to achieve your goals. However, the next time you work on a similar project, you'll know how to improve, and it will be much better because you’ve learned from the experience."
- "Would this performativity affect the results of fieldnotes? Maybe excluding or including things just so one is perceived as more anthropological?"
- "Please correct me if I am wrong but when research involves participant observation, it's important to acknowledge that you may form attachments and develop feelings about certain aspects of the experience. I believe that instead of ignoring these emotions or pretending they don't exist, it may be important to document them in your field notes to avoid bias"
- I love this idea that fieldnotes are the process of becoming."
### Annotations of ethnoGRAPHIC Fieldnotes
- In reply to this quote " Not just for their own sake,but also because of the ideal that anthropologists should be reflective andopen about their role and positioning in relation to the knowledge they gain" I said "Exactly!"
- "While I was writing my ethnography, I did quite a bit of drawing, but I never considered using it to capture small, intimate moments. I usually focused on broader scenes to show the atmosphere or feeling of a place. However, I totally agree with the author’s point, they are spot on, that drawings can effectively emphasize these small, intimate moments. This approach could show the context of a situation much better than words alone, especially for details that might otherwise be overlooked."
- "When I was doing my ethnography I found that taking photos was a really helpful tool. Being able to look back at the photos and put them into words or drawings gave my writing a much more in-depth feeling to it."
- In reply to this quote, "Sometimes I used photographs or just my memory" I said "Yes!!!"
# Week 3 fail log
## Summary of my experience
This week we are focusing on citation management software
- Zotero
## Struggles and Successes
### Zotero
- This week I really struggled with Zotero. I had already had an account and used it for other things but it did not seem to be linked to any of my emails and I could not regain access to it. I had to log out of that account and all of my citations are gone. I created a new account and that was not working for a while it took half an hour to get the account verification email. After that I tried to join the group through the link and that did not work. I checked the discussion board and luckily my professor had a work around where we had to search the group. I searched the group and still got the error message. I had to reset and redownload zotero. Safe to say I have really struggled this week. I was able to overcome everything that I was struggling with but it was very frustrating.
- Using Zotero was super easy as I have already had experience using it for other things. I think I was just having a bad technology week.

### Readings and Discussion (Perusall)
I felt like the readings and video were a lot. The first reading "The medium is the message" was a lot. I struggled throughout the week to read it taking notes as I went through it. I ended up trying to watch the video from Standford to understand some of the topics and then I couldn't access the video until this weekend (I checked the links again and it worked). With the context of the video the first reading was easier to digest. I just felt really overwhelmed this week and I ended up starting a google doc for my notes going back and forth between my tabs was really throwing me and I was just frustrated. Perusall was glitching for me as well a couple times I had written something and it would just submit the first line that I wrote so I ended up writing everything in a google doc and copy pasting. It was not my week for technology and I have come out of this week very frustrated and overwhelmed. 

## Progress on my Struggles from Last Week
- I feel pretty confident in my use of Research Rabbit, Google Scholar, and the Library Website. I am really comfortable using those things.
### What to Work on
The most important things I want to work on are figure out how to use the footnote concept on GitHub to create a table of contents. I feel it in my soul that it is possible to create table on contents with that. The other most important thing I want to work on is to figure out how to find my comments specifically on Persuall (I think I just need to star my comments so I can find all of them fast. Oh also one last thing, I really want to figure out how to seperate my paragraphs on GitHub without using hashtags or bullet points.
- Hopefully my technology decides to work next week
- Use Zotero more often
- Continue becoming more literate using these tools
- Continue to brainstorm ways to incorporate these tools into research.
## Reading for the Week
- The Medium is the Message
- Technology and History: "kranzberg's Laws"
### Annotations "The Medium is the Message"
- "I really liked this example of an abstract painting as it truly shows how we can go from imagination to creation. McCluhan seems to be emphasizing that everything we interact with or create is a reflection of human creativity. But a lot of times the processes to get there (such as how long it took for humans to make the wheel or railroad) are long and drawn out. However, despite this the "mediums" can "accelerate or amplify" everyday processes such as movement and creativity."
- "The author seems to bring up the argument of Narcissus style or trance quite a few times throughout the reading. I would be interested in reading more about this. A quick google search, no one source in particular, showed that McLuhan has quite a few papers on this concept. I would be interested to look into the Narcissus trance in relation to modern day problems people are having with AI, such as AI psychosis is this related in some way??"
- "I agree with Abby on this. Some professors are so opposed to any type of technology that they refuse to let you use those things. Normally they will say something along the lines of, "you need to know how to do it yourselves" or "the citation machines are not going to have what you need to cite and all the effort you put into creating the citation on the website you could have just made the citation in your paper."
- "I totally agree with you about desire and fantasy being connected to new technology. I also think it ties directly into McLuhan's point that technologies are extensions of us and may bring psychic and social consequences. I am pretty sure when motorcars and TVs first became popular, they were originally adopted by the wealthy and successful, symbols of status. Which created cycles of demand from everyone else (stemming from imagination). Because of that it is as if producers, manufacturers, and the wealthy manipulate desire, while the medium reshapes how everyday people think of success and belonging (social consequences)."
### Annotations "Technology and History: “Kranzberg’s Laws"
"Summary of Kranzbergs Laws:

1. Technology is not inherently anything (good, bad, neutral). Its meaning and impact depend on who is using it and how it is being used.

2. The more we invent the more we need to improve. This creates a cycle of creativity and innovation.

3. Technologies advancement toward success is due, in part, by interconnected systems all of which rely on one another. If you improve one part of the system you’ll need to improve the rest.

4. Decisions regarding technology are dominated by economic discourse and opinions of the wealthy, despite not being the most functional or optimal for the people.

5. The history of technology is the most relevant, due to its impact. An understanding of the past will allow us to understand the future and present better.

6. Technology is made for humans by humans therefore technology is a purely human result of innovation.

I find myself agreeing with the first, fourth, and sixth laws. The idea that technology itself is not good, bad, or neutral, rather shaped by human use and how it is used. The first law goes hand in hand with the fourth law. The fourth also stands out to me because, so much of technological development is driven by those with wealth and influence. One example, I can think of is the lightbulb industry; when long lasting lightbulbs were first invented manufacturers of the lightbulbs collectively agreed to shorten their lifespan so that they did not go out of business. This decision benefitted those producing the light bulbs but took away from the rest of society. Finally, the sixth law shows the main truth of technology. That technology is human. Technology reflects our creativity, intentions, motives and beliefs it mirrors who we are.

If you want to know more about the lightbulb situation The Uneasy Case of Programmed Obsolescence by Pierre-Emmanuel Moyse is a really good free paper on it."






# Week 2 fail log
## Summary of my experience
This week we are focusing on library research and literature reviewing utilizing three things:
- Research Rabbit
- Google Scholar
- University Library Resources
## Struggles and Successes
## Research Rabbit:
- I struggled a bit with Research Rabbit. I could not figure out how to exit after I posted a new article in the shared collection. The answer was right in front of my eyes. If I hovered over the section on the right (1 selected paper) an X would appear and I would be able to exit back to the main page. I reread the materials and watched the video and was able to figure it out.

- Another skill I learned was how to add articles to shared collections on Research Rabbit. I added the article "Addendum: The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (2019)" because the originial article "The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (2016)" was in the collection already. From my understanding an Addendum is an addition or revision going into more detail from previous work, so I thought that it was important to include the addendum from the original article in the collection. Research Rabbit utilizes a similar work feature. This feature shows you similar work to the article or collection you are working on. I have added the before and after images of the similar work section, which show the difference between the section before and after I added the article to the collection. You can really see a difference between the two.

## Google Scholar
- This week I compared Google Scholar to Microsoft Bing, both of which I am familiar with so I was easily able to navigate I googled "Open Data Archeology" on both of the platforms and there were some noticable differences. On Microsoft Bing there were a lot more open data centers where I could go to get or publish data, which would facilitate actual use of data for research. On Google Scholar there were research articles where I could read about open data and the importance of it in archaeology. I would use Microsoft Bing if I was looking for actual data or wanted to publish some data, while I would use Google Scholar to do research or write about the importance of open data in archaeology.
### Microsoft Bing

### Google Scholar

## University Library Resource
- This week I watch videos kindly provided by our university librarian in regards to our universitys library. I was happy to see that the universitys library website works with zotero, which I have used for other classes. One thing I learned this week from the videos is that I can just input key words into the search. In the past, I had always done phrases or sentences and it seems like key words is an easier way to navigate the website.
- I have always preferred Google Scholar to the library website and I still believe that holds true. But, I will continue to use my university account to gain access to otherwise locked articles on Google Scholar
### Progress on my struggles from last week
I have become more literate when utilizing GitHub and Persuall. Although, I am still working on certain aspects for markdowns. For example, I am trying to add a footnote to my blog post for the week and it is not neccesarily working how it is meant to. I have finally figured it out!! I had not been including the semicolon on the second part of the footnote. 
I feel way more comfortable navigating the two with a bit of practice and experience.
## What to work on
- Brainstorming ideas for how I can incorporate Research Rabbit into my current research.
- Continue to become more literate using Persuall and GitHub.
## Reading for the Week
[Will it Ever be FAIR](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/will-it-ever-be-fair/9073D28A74C2FE87E53B3C5A7437AC74)
### Week 2 Will It Ever Be FAIR Annotations:
- "This section stood out to me because it really puts into perspective the fact that you can do your best to implement policies incorporating the FAIR and Care principles, but if the "stewards" of this do not take appropriate steps the whole system could be impacted"
- "Is this something that CRM firms are implementing currently or thinking about implementing? If not, if professional organizations do endorse the FAIR and CARE principles would they then be able to push/work with CRM firms to implement the principles. A sort of lead by example situation starting with the professional societies."
- "This appears to be something that graduate students, undergraduates, and professionals would all run into. Creating busy work "data munging" rather than allowing the individuals time on their research. Ultimately, taking away from the whole of anthropology. Is there a source that discusses how "data munging" impacts research throughout the entity of anthropology?"











# Week 1 fail log 
## Summary of my experience
The first week in this class, I spent trying to figure out how to use GitHub, which, honestly, I am not the best at, I have encountered a lot of times where I was a bit confused setting this all up. Eventually, I gave in and googled a step due to my lack of knowledge surrounding this website. For example, I couldn't figure out how to edit, and after a couple of minutes of looking around I finally googled and learned that the way to edit these pages was right in front of my eyes... all I had to do was click the pencil icon. 
I also spent a lot of time figuring out another website called Perusall, where I am able to annotate and comment on my course readings. I did a practice comment that is linked here [Week 1 Perusall Practice Comment](https://app.perusall.com/courses/fall-2025-anthropology-of-science-and-technology-anth-410r-950/digital-anthropology-syllabus-553064581?annotationId=ZyuyYExzhnp3Qqngx.) This is important as it is helping me learn how to work Perusall and Github. I am excited to continue learning and working through some things that I do not necessarily understand. 
## Things I want to work on
Next week I hope that I am more literate in Github and Persuall. I hope that over the weekend I watch some videos on these things and educate myself more on them.
### Week 1 Syllabus Annotations:
"Excited to learn better ways to document research "fail" processes in a positive way."
