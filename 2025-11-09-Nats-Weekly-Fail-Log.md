# Readings
## On Using Archives and Freedom of Information Act for Anthropological Research
### Comments
- This seems like it will be super helpful!
## 	Anthropologists in the Archives A Brief Guide for the Perplexed
### Comments
- This is not the first time this book has been mentioned in the readings this week. I might check it out. Albeit, I did the readings completely out of order so maybe this is the first time this has been mentioned. (The book is called Threatening Anthropology)
- Oh wow, this is pretty cool as well. Although it may not be updated since 2009. (I'm not sure how this works)
- There should be a standard which is followed for archivists (I do not think this exists right now). A big issue in archives is that certain archivists will come and organize in a way no one understands or not organize at all. Leaving future archivists to clean up and make sense of what is left behind. If anything, one of the most important parts of archival research from what I have experienced is taking notes of every single thing you do, why, and making those notes accessible from future archivists to see.
## Listmania A Few Thoughts on One Page From a 6,500 Cubic Feet Collection 
### Comments
- I had never heard of the McCarthy era before. I googled it and it seems like a very politically charged time. This is definitely something I will look more into in the future.
- We have been learning about this history of anthropologists being pressured to conform or working with the government for their own personal gain in one [redacted]. I highly recommend it. But back to the quote... the list targeting activists is still something we see today from certain organizations unfortunately. A quick scroll through one such list has people on there for teaching things such as women's and queer studies. Sad to see this is still something professors and activists alike are dealing with today
## Katherine Dunham papers Finding Aid
### Comments
- It was really eye opening to scroll through this and see how much Katherine Dunham was involved with. I saw things from Black Panther to Dora mentioned in her correspondences. I think this really shows the scope of an anthropologists reach and impact in history
## Trnascriptions of Dunhams Notes
### Comments
- Transcription Page 4-5 I am still working on this but it is a rough draft: My rashing, This would add perhaps 2 each month At first I was a little annoyed by Paul eulogism and the becugatim a chided him for laughing undo in his currently in his tradition. "Oh yea" he haid, with a little condescension for my point and wew but then, after all, what does it do for me to the a Haitian if I die still working here all day like this and momrey to even above one gaud a month for data on to often a little shove a or something. All day every day, Mlle. No Christmas, no Sunday, no saints' days, no day to visit your family in the Christmas, no Nelle, I'd matter the American and not be a Haitian. I wonder how long Paul will continue with this disgust to work and to work well which to he an integral part of his motive. Maybe others of his kind one the most leaped and the pearchant. One day they will not make create mythical values on go frying down the steps in resonance to a commercial they will have grasped the true sight of that earlier independence and the true meaning of the Haitian fractured egalite which grasses the Haitian east games. "Had the American not drained the perfection Nelle, there would have been a salvation long before this" The someone tried me. And even no if something isn't love, we will have to resort to communism. and that will be defendable.
