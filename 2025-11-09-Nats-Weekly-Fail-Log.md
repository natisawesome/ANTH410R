## Summary of my Experience

### Video on Apparatus Theory 
- Perspective transforms via the eye of the beholder but also by the society and influences in which the beholder is a member of.
- Continuity, the lie in the eye of the beholder, still images to motion by suppression
- We are all subjects, the feeling of being a subject, good feelings which are false 
- Sense of control because of the possibilities of choice 
- Continuity, camera movement, and classical narrative continutiy are all used to create stories
### Photo Assignment 1
I tried to do this at the conference I was at but it did not end well. So once I got back I was able to find a pillow case which was black and a book. I set the pillow case up so that it looked like a porper backdrop, and I put the book under it for a flat surface. I had a big light overtop of the figurine, a lamp coming in from the left, and my roomates camera coming in from the right. In the past I have had the opprotunity to photograph archeolgoical units and skeletal remains. This mostly aligns with the skeletal remains. As I photgraphed those after completing layouts my team and I would be so meticulous with how the backdrop looked we would use a lint roller to make sure there were no fuzzes sticking up and we would pull the ends to make sure there were no wrinkles. I feel like this is a very important skill to learn in the field of anthropology.

### Photo Assignment 2
I really enjoyed this assignment as it really allows you to see in different perspectives. I think that is so important especially when you are conceptualizing something in an image. All images tell a story as we learned in the apparatus theory videos. To take something and change the context of it is to change its story and our undeerstanding of it.
I chose to change the lighting, background, and angle in these images. The original image in assignment 1 had a black backdrop with three sources of lighting and a scale.

The first image above shows the wooden figurine on a black purse, which is hanging on the wall. This image has two sources of lighting. The lighting is a main light coming in from the top and a side light which is coming in from the right side of the image. I chose this background because I thought a purse hanging on a wall with a wooden figure was very different from what people normally see. It was also taller than me so I feel like the image is a bit imposing. 

The second image pictured above is an image of the wooden figurine on a desk next to a light. I chose this because this is the normal spot for this figurine. I thought it would be important to see the normal environment after seeing two other images, the first in assignment one and the second in this assignment, of the figure out of place. This image only has one source of light, which is the light next to it. Additionally, the angle is downwards.

### Photo Assignment 3
This was my favorite part of the assignment. i actually struggled to identify who I was going to chose for this interview. Some of my responsibility for the conference was to conduct student interviews and work for the student committee to do so properly as I have experince with ethnographies and proper interview process. I interviewed a lot of people on topics pertaining to the conference. However, the one that stood out most to me was the one I did with my friend. That is what I based this assignment off of.
I was in San Diego for a conference this week. There I was able to interview one of my dear friends Kat. Who has given permission to use her nickname, photo, and quotes from the interview. I started off this conversation by asking her if she had any words of wisdom for future students who struggle with motivation, what would it be.

Interview with Kat:

K: "Coffee is not just a drink it is a way of life."

N: What makes you say that?

K: "Sometimes when I do not feel like getting up in the morning or taking on responsibilities a moment of peace, quiet, and coffee give me the energy to take on the day. Coffee may not be the same for everyone find something that means coffee to you."

### comments
Quote: "photographs suggest meaning through theway in which they are structured, for representational form makes an imageaccessible and comprehensible to the mind, informing and informed by awhole hidden corpus of knowledge that is called on through the signifiers inthe image’ (1992:8). Hence, the interpretation of photographs largely hingeson the subjective" I replied to this and said I really like this quote

Yes!! That is what it seems like they are referring to. I really love this. It seems like the photographs give the audience a way to understand the emotional registers that were within the conversations
