# Week 8 fail log
## Summary of my Experience
Introduction to R

### R
Honestly, I really struggled with some of the challenges of this unit. I do not like R very much or I need much more practice using R. I think it is a really good data tool though and I can understand the importance of knowing it exists and using it in applicable research. I would be intrested in maybe watching some videos on R. 
I wonder if there is a way to link R up in such a way that it would be similar to an excel workbook. Where you can have one master sheet and when you update that it updates all the little ones or vice versa. It would be intresting if you could just query that data from one location.
## What to Work on for Next Week

## Is This the End of Anthropology as We Know It? SomeImplication of FAIR Principles on Tales in Ethnological andAnthropological Qualitative Research
### comments
- I really like this point. Finding and working with "interlocutors" is sort of an "initiation process" within the field. This process teaches people that the data and research is not just data and research; the data represents little parts of people lives and history. Without firsthand understanding of the process, it may be difficult to grasp the meaning of data and why open access with the permission of the interlocutor or confidentiality per the request of the interlocutor is vital.
- Honestly, this has been something on my mind recently in terms of accessibility. This statistic shows that 90.9% of the anthropologists interviewed said they share research via "scientific papers, book chapters, or something similar". That is a HUGE amount. This does not seem accessible to the general public, just academic scholars. Many of the individuals who we get our research from are members of the general public rather than academic scholars. Are scientific fields taking steps to make their research and data more accessible and readable to the general public, without the academic jargon or the intimidation that comes with heavily academic articles and books? Would accessible data in general also be considering ways to make data more accessible not only for researchers but also for anyone interested and those who we work with to gain the data in the first place?
##  Data sharing in biological anthropology: Guiding principlesand best practices
### comments
- Yes! I think it is really important to remember this. Especially the next part of the quote that discusses a conversation about a consenting process.
