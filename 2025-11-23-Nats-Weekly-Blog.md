# Week 14 
## Senses
I am personalizing these descriptions so they may not be accurate for all who read.
### Taste
The taste of my moms meatloaf. This is rich and oniony. A bitter sweet dish that is perfectly made. The onion and worcestershire sauce balanced out with cottage cheese. Although it seems rather strange to taste all of those things together they go together perfectly. This is the taste of home. The meatloaf melts when you cut into it. When you take a bite its the sauce and onion that hit you first as the piece slowly melts on your tongue. As you start chewing the sweetness of the cottage cheese makes you want even more. It is like a day in elementry school the feeling of being a kid again and remembering all of the times your mom made you this food when you were sick. 
### Touch
The touch of my dogs fur. The feeling of coming home. A warm hug. The dogs jump on me when I get back surrounding me in love and peace. The fur feels as if I have touched clouds, or maybe the softest of snows if it were warm. A silk web of tangly delight. A reminder of home when its missed and of past pets that live on through the new ones. The fur is as soft as silk, the dogs leave lots behind so you will always find a piece here and there. It is not itchy or off putting it is simply the softest thing you could imagine. It is comparable to that of an alpaca if you have ever felt or worn something made of alpaca fur like I have you would know that it is as soft as can be without being itchy like wool can be. The feeling of it not only reminds me of home and peace but also fun and excitement. Pure joy is emenated through this feeling, the dogs run wild and care free and you get a piece of that when you pet them. 
### Smell
Lavender. You are running through a flower field. This smell takes you to a beautiful sunny place. It is the smell of relaxation and harmony with nature. The summer sun and sandy beaches. Hawaii coastlines and lavender fields. The smelly pillow you had as a child. A diffuser at work. A room spray in your apartment. This smell is everywhere. It is so peaceful and a reminder of your past and your present. This is also the taste of one of your favorite types of lemonades. A brunch spot with your best friends and this lemonade. The smell of lavender bringing people together. A uniting smell that means friendship and home.

This week in my blog I actually wanted to talk about my capstone project. I am attempting to 3D scan artifacts and create a digital museum display. However, I have come across a bit of difficultly with that. I found 3 supposedly free apps that work really well. Unfortunatly, they are not actually free. You can scan but not export without paying. Or you have a limited number of scans that do not really matter if you delete something (so my practice scans counted in these numbers and I cannot undo them) all three of the apps I was able to at least get a practice scan done to see if I would like working with the software. I have a personal favorite in the three apps.
The three apps are:
## Capture
  I found capture to be the most user friendly, free, and plausable. However, once you scan a couple times it asks you to pay, but does not make you pay to export. I am also having issues with the scans that although I am able to capture the tops, sides, and bottoms of the artifacts the details are REALLY lacking on the scans. You can see the shape and what the artifact is but nothing more indepth than that.
## Dot3D
This was a disappointment once you try to scan you have to pay. Waiting to enable free trail to see if this works.

## PolyCam
This is the middle ground and this should be the best as it works with Lidar. You get 10 free scans before you have to pay. I find the scanning very difficult and not user friendly or undeerstandable at all. However, this does include tutorial videos so that is very helpful. However, I have no actually been able to figure out how to scan more than just the top of the artifact.

I have some work arounds for the payment issues everything offers free trials so once we are back from break if I enable the week long free trial I should at least be able to attempt scans again with these three softwares. I also have another possible solution. The Center has a 3D Scanner that I am going to set up and attempt to use. I should be able to export the scans of artifacts onto my laptop and then sketchfab to create the digital museum display. This was my last resort as it has never been used before, but I think it may be at least slightly better than the apps and hopefully will get all of the details. My current plan is to try this out once I get back and if it does not work properly I will resort to the free trials on the apps.
