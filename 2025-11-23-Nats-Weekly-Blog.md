# Week 14 
This week in my blog I actually wanted to talk about my capstone project. I am attempting to 3D scan artifacts and create a digital museum display. However, I have come across a bit of difficultly with that. I found 3 supposedly free apps that work really well. Unfortunatly, they are not actually free. You can scan but not export without paying. Or you have a limited number of scans that do not really matter if you delete something (so my practice scans counted in these numbers and I cannot undo them) all three of the apps I was able to at least get a practice scan done to see if I would like working with the software. I have a personal favorite in the three apps.
The three apps are:
## Capture
  I found capture to be the most user friendly, free, and plausable. However, once you scan a couple times it asks you to pay, but does not make you pay to export. I am also having issues with the scans that although I am able to capture the tops, sides, and bottoms of the artifacts the details are REALLY lacking on the scans. You can see the shape and what the artifact is but nothing more indepth than that.
## Dot3D
This was a disappointment once you try to scan you have to pay. Waiting to enable free trail to see if this works.

## PolyCam
This is the middle ground and this should be the best as it works with Lidar. You get 10 free scans before you have to pay. I find the scanning very difficult and not user friendly or undeerstandable at all. However, this does include tutorial videos so that is very helpful. However, I have no actually been able to figure out how to scan more than just the top of the artifact.

I have some work arounds for the payment issues everything offers free trials so once we are back from break if I enable the week long free trial I should at least be able to attempt scans again with these three softwares. I also have another possible solution. The Center has a 3D Scanner that I am going to set up and attempt to use. I should be able to export the scans of artifacts onto my laptop and then sketchfab to create the digital museum display. This was my last resort as it has never been used before, but I think it may be at least slightly better than the apps and hopefully will get all of the details. My current plan is to try this out once I get back and if it does not work properly I will resort to the free trials on the apps.
