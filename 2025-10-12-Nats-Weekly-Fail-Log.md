# Week 9 fail log
## Summary of my Experience
Audio Recording an Manipulation

### Audacity 
Audacity gave me a bit of trouble at first because I didn’t realize I had to download multiple components to get it to work. However, once I did, the process became pretty straightforward. I recorded my interview on my phone using Voice Memos, but it wouldn’t accept any of the file formats I tried to convert it to. I’m not sure why that was the case, but I was able to experiment with the practice file provided in class this week. 

I really liked using Audacity, and I think that next time, I will be more aware of what file types it does and does not accept. I can definitely see myself using this software in the future; it seems quite in-depth and reminds me of a system I used in a cinema class for video projects, although I can’t quite remember its name. Overall, Audacity is definitely user-friendly and perfect for projects like this.
## What to Work on for Next Week
- Start final project

# Readings

## An Artificial Environment is Often a Noisy Environment: Auditory SceneAnalysis and Speech Perception in Noise
### comments
- I use white noise as well for something in the background. It's interesting that they choose to use that for this study.

## Seeing, Hearing, FeelingSound and the Despotism of the Eyein “Visual” Anthropology
### comments
- I totally agree with you. This gives us such a good description. A lot of this reading has reminded me of a trend I have seen in popular media, especially around Halloween. It is where people put random music to horror movie scenes and then say the only reason it was scary was because of the sound. Sound gives us such an atmosphere and almost transports us to the moment we are seeing on the screen or hearing. It is a way that we can connect with others experiences and I think that a lack of sound is just as important.

## Hearing Cultures 1-20
### comments
- I am glad that this is being mentioned. I think with a lot of the topics discussed in the readings about sound medicine is overlooked. Sound and what we expose ourselves to can be healing, which just goes to show how important sound is to convey things
-  I really like your take on this. These are such important questions to ask and consider for an accessible and equal field of anthropology
-  I just want to say in general I love the concept of "hearing cultures." I feel like anthropology as a whole talks so much about observation but neglects hearing. Rather sight, taste, and smell are primary senses in many ethnographies. I wonder if there are readings on anthropological ethnography which emphasize the use of all the senses and teach students how to do so without favoring one? I would be interested to try out a method like that.
