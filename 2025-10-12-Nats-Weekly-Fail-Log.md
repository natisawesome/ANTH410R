# Week 9 fail log
## Summary of my Experience
Audio Recording an Manipulation

### Audacity 
Audacity gave me a bit of trouble at first because I didn’t realize I had to download multiple components to get it to work. However, once I did, the process became pretty straightforward. I recorded my interview on my phone using Voice Memos, but it wouldn’t accept any of the file formats I tried to convert it to. I’m not sure why that was the case, but I was able to experiment with the practice file provided in class this week. 

I really liked using Audacity, and I think that next time, I will be more aware of what file types it does and does not accept. I can definitely see myself using this software in the future; it seems quite in-depth and reminds me of a system I used in a cinema class for video projects, although I can’t quite remember its name. Overall, Audacity is definitely user-friendly and perfect for projects like this.
