### Comments
- I really like how the author states this. For me, I do not normally think that that I have sensory biases, but this really puts it into perspective. The importance our society puts on things such as sight and smell would definitely implicate the research into senses within other cultures. This also shows how perception and one's environment shape what they consciously pick up on. I really like the third point this author brings up as well (I know I did not highlight it) but I think the concept of being able to move between two sensory orders is really interesting. It is moving between categories and structurally relearning everything from your culture to properly engage with another.
- I agree.
