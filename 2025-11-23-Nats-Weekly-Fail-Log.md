# Week 14 fail log
## Summary of my Experience

## Senses
I am personalizing these descriptions so they may not be accurate for all who read.
### Taste
The taste of my moms meatloaf. This is rich and oniony. A bitter sweet dish that is perfectly made. The onion and worcestershire sauce balanced out with cottage cheese. Although it seems rather strange to taste all of those things together they go together perfectly. This is the taste of home. The meatloaf melts when you cut into it. When you take a bite its the sauce and onion that hit you first as the piece slowly melts on your tongue. As you start chewing the sweetness of the cottage cheese makes you want even more. It is like a day in elementry school the feeling of being a kid again and remembering all of the times your mom made you this food when you were sick. 
### Touch
The touch of my dogs fur. The feeling of coming home. A warm hug. The dogs jump on me when I get back surrounding me in love and peace. The fur feels as if I have touched clouds, or maybe the softest of snows if it were warm. A silk web of tangly delight. A reminder of home when its missed and of past pets that live on through the new ones. The fur is as soft as silk, the dogs leave lots behind so you will always find a piece here and there. It is not itchy or off putting it is simply the softest thing you could imagine. It is comparable to that of an alpaca if you have ever felt or worn something made of alpaca fur like I have you would know that it is as soft as can be without being itchy like wool can be. The feeling of it not only reminds me of home and peace but also fun and excitement. Pure joy is emenated through this feeling, the dogs run wild and care free and you get a piece of that when you pet them. 
### Smell
Lavender. You are running through a flower field. This smell takes you to a beautiful sunny place. It is the smell of relaxation and harmony with nature. The summer sun and sandy beaches. Hawaii coastlines and lavender fields. The smelly pillow you had as a child. A diffuser at work. A room spray in your apartment. This smell is everywhere. It is so peaceful and a reminder of your past and your present. This is also the taste of one of your favorite types of lemonades. A brunch spot with your best friends and this lemonade. The smell of lavender bringing people together. A uniting smell that means friendship and home.

# Readings
## Doing Sensory Anthropology
### Comments
- I really like how the author states this. For me, I do not normally think that that I have sensory biases, but this really puts it into perspective. The importance our society puts on things such as sight and smell would definitely implicate the research into senses within other cultures. This also shows how perception and one's environment shape what they consciously pick up on. I really like the third point this author brings up as well (I know I did not highlight it) but I think the concept of being able to move between two sensory orders is really interesting. It is moving between categories and structurally relearning everything from your culture to properly engage with another.
- I agree.
- I think this is a really interesting point. I never considered that the importance of senses changed with stages of life, but it makes a lot of sense. Different age groups are indoctrinated into what is meant to be important for them.

 ## Film and new food rituals in the time of COVID-19 – TANGIBLE TERRITORY
 ### Comments
- A professor showed us this video in one of his classes. It evokes such emotion from the audience. If you have not seen the video, I highly recommend it. I have linked it if anyone wants to watch it. Presidents Choice Ad

## Uploading the ancestors: Experiments with digital Buddhist altars in contemporary Japan
### Comments
- I agree. This is a totally new concept to me that seems really interesting.
- It's interesting to consider how although the digital may be more accessible that it can't necessarily replace the physical because of things that the digital realm cannot yet replicate like the senses. If or when technology comes to a point where it can replicate the physical tactile senses, I wonder if digital infrastructures of things like this overtake physical.
