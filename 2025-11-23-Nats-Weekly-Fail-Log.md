## Doing Sensory Anthropology
### Comments
- I really like how the author states this. For me, I do not normally think that that I have sensory biases, but this really puts it into perspective. The importance our society puts on things such as sight and smell would definitely implicate the research into senses within other cultures. This also shows how perception and one's environment shape what they consciously pick up on. I really like the third point this author brings up as well (I know I did not highlight it) but I think the concept of being able to move between two sensory orders is really interesting. It is moving between categories and structurally relearning everything from your culture to properly engage with another.
- I agree.
- I think this is a really interesting point. I never considered that the importance of senses changed with stages of life, but it makes a lot of sense. Different age groups are indoctrinated into what is meant to be important for them.

 ### Comments
- A professor showed us this video in one of his classes. It evokes such emotion from the audience. If you have not seen the video, I highly recommend it. I have linked it if anyone wants to watch it. Presidents Choice Ad

## Uploading the ancestors: Experiments with digital Buddhist altars in contemporary Japan
### Comments
- I agree. This is a totally new concept to me that seems really interesting.
- It's interesting to consider how although the digital may be more accessible that it can't necessarily replace the physical because of things that the digital realm cannot yet replicate like the senses. If or when technology comes to a point where it can replicate the physical tactile senses, I wonder if digital infrastructures of things like this overtake physical.
