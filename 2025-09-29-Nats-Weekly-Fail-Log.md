# Week 6 fail log
## Summary of my Experience
This week we are focusing on Data Managment. Specifically:
- Data Management Plans (DMP)
- Organization
- Security
- Metadata
## Data Management Plans
Data Management plans are comprised of information such as data collection, documentation and metadata, ethics and legal compliance, storage and backup, selection and preservation, data sharing, responsibilities and resources, and outcome. This essentially puts the plan for your research in one place creating a guide you can refer to during the data collection and research process. I really liked this activity, although I will say it took a lot of time. I used my current research as the example. Although, I will say that I found myself repeating myself a lot in the DMP. The questions felt very repetative especially for someone with a research project that is not as indepth as practiced researchers.

## Organization
During the folder and filename activity I realized I need to be better at creating files. I looked back at my previous research and instead of it being in one folder together it was all scattered saved in different areas. I did save it physically and online in multiple places. One thing I can improve on would definitely be organization. So I have made a plan for my current research and grant work.
- Log everything in a word document
- have a page with sources and links
- Create a file for all of the items I use for the research


## Security
I feel confident in security. My passwords are all different and I have all of my research in secure places. I also use two factor identification, and have multiple backups of my worok that I continuously update. I would say I passed that safety and security test.


## Metadata
Recently, I have started to keep metadata. I am working on a grant that is ArcGIS Pro and that is very important in ArcGIS Pro. I think that this is still something I could improve on. I am going to keep working on my notes and continue to add metadata to all of my work. 

## What to Work on for Next Week
Next week I want to continue working through all of my files and put them in appropriate folders. I also want to keep working with GitHub on making my faillog and blog more cohesive.

# Readings

## Introduction: Towards ananthropology of data
### comments
- I really like this phrase, "data's ubiquity and polysemy," because it shows how data is used in almost everything but in different ways.
- I really like this idea as well. I think it makes a lot of sense to further understand those providing data.
- I agree with you. I think overdetermine if the wrong word. If anything it should be underdetermine. Solely because of what it could be

##  The datafication of nature: dataformations and new scales innatural history
### comments
- I really like the picture this paints us. It reminds me a lot of curatorial work in anthropology. Being stuck between past (what the artifacts are currently), present (what the artifacts are becoming), and future (what the artifacts will be). As artifacts are digitized, they exist in a state of transition, suspended in a "multidimensional modernizing process". Curators and technology together transform them into something new, making them accessible to anyone interested and elevating their visibility in ways we haven't seen before.


## Exercise: Reusing qualitative data: the value of context
### comments
- How does perception of health, familial relations and cultural norms, impact eating healthy.
- Information such as age, location, time, and status of the individuals would all help better understand the extracts.
- Age, location, time period, and the status of the individuals are important factors that provide essential context. Understanding these elements, such as whether individuals are older or younger, the era they belong to, their status, and their geographic location will greatly enhance the ability to interpret their responses and the questions they are asked. Without this context, meaningful interpretation is difficult, and the information cannot be effectively used in research.
- Yes, I agree. I think there is a difference between diet and healthier lifestyle. One is short term for the benefit of the individual. While the other is a long-term way of living. I wonder if this gets differentiated in the parts of the interview that are cut out.
