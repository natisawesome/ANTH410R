# Week 1 fail log
Admittedly, I had a difficult first week. I was able to create my GitHub and Perusall accounts but there were a few hiccups (that I annotated using Perusall).   

## First Annotation
My [first annotation](https://app.perusall.com/courses/empowering-anthropological-research-in-the-digital-age-dev-stantis/digital-anthropology-syllabus?annotationId=9gq6QyLZRRRtmGiQw) was about my engagement hours. I need to pay attention to Bookings requests- the head of the Center for Teaching Excellence taught me about them, but I'm not used to this feature of the school's Outlook system.

## Second Annotation
My [second annotation](https://app.perusall.com/courses/empowering-anthropological-research-in-the-digital-age-dev-stantis/digital-anthropology-syllabus?annotationId=YMgufHS3YwDsSe442) relates to topics for the course. There's still some topics I'm not sure about. 


## Third Annotation
My [third annotation](https://app.perusall.com/courses/empowering-anthropological-research-in-the-digital-age-dev-stantis/digital-anthropology-syllabus?annotationId=SvtCsm8oFJ34ic5Wp) was a case of me remembering how daunting it was to first go through D2L. The first two semesters at SIU, I couldn't figure out how some students had added pronouns to their D2L profiles. 

## Comments/Concerns

Overall, this week went well. It seemed daunting at first, but I soon realized that everyone makes mistakes, especially when they are learning new skills, using new software, etc. **Making mistakes is part of the process and necessary to learn.**

I am a bit concerned about diving into GitHub next week, but I see there are instruction videos which I imagine will help a lot!
