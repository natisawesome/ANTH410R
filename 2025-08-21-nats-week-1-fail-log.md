# Week 1 fail log
## Summary of my experience
The first week in this class, I spent trying to figure out how to use GitHub, which, honestly, I am not the best at, I have encountered a lot of times where I was a bit confused setting this all up. Eventually, I gave in and googled a step due to my lack of knowledge surrounding this website. For example, I couldn't figure out how to edit, and after a couple of minutes of looking around I finally googled and learned that the way to edit these pages was right in front of my eyes... all I had to do was click the pencil icon. 
I also spent a lot of time figuring out another website called Perusall, where I am able to annotate and comment on my course readings. I did a practice comment that is linked here [Week 1 Perusall Practice Comment](https://app.perusall.com/courses/fall-2025-anthropology-of-science-and-technology-anth-410r-950/digital-anthropology-syllabus-553064581?annotationId=ZyuyYExzhnp3Qqngx.) This is important it is helping me learn how to work Perusall and Github.
