# Week 7
This week, we focused on cleaning data. I really enjoyed the readings and lecture videos, which helped me gain a better understanding of the importance of data cleaning and accessibility. The readings went into the ethical considerations surrounding the relationship between researchers and those being researched. One of the readings highlighted that written consent forms could jeopardize the safety of individuals, which is why oral consent is often preferred. Anonymity is the default in research, but if an individual is not anonymous, I believe it could be important to implement a multistep consent process at the beginning, middle, and end. This ensures that the individuals being researched understand the implications and know they can revoke consent at any time once the research has started. When individuals are not anonymous, there should be protections in place for both the researcher and the research subjects.


Additionally, in the first part of the lecture video, there was a quote: "The Data Availability Statement should identify restrictions and necessary permissions for access to data, as well as provide a plan for the free sharing of information with descendant groups while also guarding the privacy of sensitive information" - AJBA Author Guide. I feel that this quote perfectly describes our obligations as anthropologists. Personally, I hope to become a forensic anthropologist or bioarchaeologist. I have learned that my role in this field is to state facts and convey truths that already exist. I do not own any data or information; I am simply the pen that puts it on paper, much like a court reporter documenting someone else's case. Of course, I am not emotionally detached, but it is important to remember that in this field, particularly depending on oneâ€™s focus, it is not about you; it is about others and what they can share with you. The wisdom and stories an anthropologist can gather come from listening, observing, and recognizing what is already there. Without other humans or individuals willing to share their experiences, anthropology as a whole would collapse. We are the storytellers of humanity, and it is our duty to ensure that these stories are told in the most accessible and ethical way possible.
