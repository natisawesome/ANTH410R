# Introduction
Hi, I am Nat a current undergraduate student in anthropology. My passions in anthropology are bioarcaeology and forensic anthropology. In the future, I hope to do government work in relation to repatriation of fallen soliders, or humanitarian work to help identify and repatriate those who suffered at the hands of genocide around the world. This passion of mine was inspired by my family members who survived the holocaust, many of them did not. I hope I will be able to bring closure to families who were always left wondering what happened and where their family members ended up. This blog will follow my journey through a class that focuses on science and technology in anthropology. I'm excited to start learning!!

## Learning Goals
# Week 2
## Lessons of the week
Thie week I explored Library Research and Literature Review tools. This exploration included Research Rabbit, Google Scholar, and my schools online library. As I was familirizing myself with these tools I realized that I prefered certain tools over others, and in discussion this week one of my peers (PVM) pointed out that Research Rabbit does a lot of things that Google Scholar does. I whole heartedly agree with this. After exploring, I feel like Google Scholar is the "old" while Research Rabbit is the "new". Research Rabbit allows you to see timelines, connections, and similar articles compared to the sources or articles that you are using. This can save students and professionals a lot of time that they would otherwise spend "data munging" when they are doing research. Rather than be hunting for articles and not finding anything they are automatically recommended to you. But I will still be using other tools such as Google Scholar and my universitys library to find articles as well. 

I will say though, that this does generate some questions from me about how the recommendations work. Are certain articles going to be recommended more than others? How unbiased is Research Rabbit? Have there been any times where it should be recommending something but it is not? 
# Week 1
## Lessons of the Week
I followed all the directions that I was provided and have also been reading the extra information that has been linked. My favorite helpful links that were provided for Github specifically are: [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) This week has also shown me that even though things appear unfamiliar, it will be okay, no matter what with the support of my peers and the instructions provided by my instructor I will be able to figure out how to work new things. Additionally, even if I do not get it on the first try that reviewing the instructions and using my sources I will get closer to the answer in my next couple of trys.
